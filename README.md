# Grid Overlay Image Picker

This is an adaptation of code by CoDrops (http://www.codrops.com)

# Main Structure

This image picker starts with a single image. You can scroll through the other pictures using the arrows at the bottom.  If you click on the image thumbnails will appear.  Clicking on them loads a larger version.

Most everything is handled by three .js files:

appshowcase.js controls all of the functions.
modernizr.custom.js handles browser compatability.

style.css has all the formatting for the page, as well as some responsive commands.

Good luck!
